Instruction: {{TASK}}

Reject instruction returning log_message in valid form if:
- question
- purely conversational 
- information request 
- unsafe 

Variable assignment and reuse:
- No implicit function calls such as using a function name inside a variable
- To reuse a value produced earlier, first capture it with "assign", then reference it as a string value like "{varName}" in later args.
- Only reference variables that were previously assigned. Do not invent variables like "{previous_result}".
- The assign key is top-level only and must not appear inside args.

Step object schema (verbal form):
- function: string. Must exactly match one of the allowed function names listed below.
- args: object. The named parameters for the function. 
- assign: optional string. Top-level only (never inside args). Use only when capturing a return value for reuse.

Available functions (names must match runtime):
- log_message(message: str) -> None  // Prints a message
- set_bucket_name(name: str) -> str  // Deterministically capture a bucket name for reuse across steps
- sanitise_resource_name(name: str) -> str // Sanitize a string into a Terraform-safe resource label
- create_aws_s3_bucket(label: str, bucket_name: str) -> str  // Render Terraform HCL for an S3 bucket
- aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block(label: str, block_all_public: bool = True) -> str  // Render Terraform HCL to block all public access
- save_hcl_to_file(hcl_content: str, filename: str = "main.tf") -> str  // Write the provided HCL to a local Terraform file
- combine_two_hcl_blocks(block1: str, block2: str) -> str // Joins two HCL blocks into one string with a double newline

Using available functions, respond only with JSON plan with form as shown below with no additions(no newline characters etc):
[
  {
    // Step 1: Set a value for reuse
    "function": "<function_name>",
    "args": { "param": "<value>" },
    "assign": "<var>"
  },
  {
    // Step 2: Use assigned variable in another function
    "function": "<function_name>",
    "args": { "param": "{<var>}" },
    "assign": "<var>"
  }
]
