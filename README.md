# AGX-public

This is the public facing repository for my startup AGX. 
AGX contrains the output of an LLM to a premade function library to generate correct Terraform.

Live demo here: [agx.run](https://agx.run)

## Updates
### October 2025
An open source CLI for AGX is currently under development.
This will be a natural language CLI that connects to the AGX backend will be released Q1/Q2 2026.

*The codebase for AGX is private, this repository is for providing updates*
