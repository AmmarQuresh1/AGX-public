This is the public facing repository for my startup AGX.  
AGX constrains the output of an LLM to a premade function library to generate correct Terraform.

Live demo here: [agx.run](https://agx.run)

## Updates
### October 2025
An open source CLI for AGX is currently under development.  
This will be a natural language CLI connected to the AGX backend, scheduled for release Q1/Q2 2026.

*The codebase for AGX is private; this repository is for providing updates.*
